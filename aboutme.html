	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Who is Buğra Fatih Demiryürek?</h2>

	<blockquote>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his first years of high school, Buğra started listening to rock music thanks to his friend. He wanted to play guitar so he bought his first guitar at 14. After taking some lessons from an instructor, he realized that he wants to play electric guitar. After some months later, he bought his first electric guitar and started learning it by himself. With his rapid learning and ability, he was able to play some classic rock and metal songs and he wanted to form his first band. His first band was with his classmates and they used to play Metallica, Megadeth songs. They played at some shows and festivals by their schools at that time. Some months later, unfortunately that band had to split up.

	<blockquote>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the split up, he realized that he wanted to write his own songs rather than playing cover songs of other bands. No matter how hard he tried those years, he couldn't start a band at first. Therefore, he wanted to learn drums, bass, keyboard and synths. Spending a couple years on electric guitar and other instruments, he wanted to focus on the harmony and music writing. With his studies on music theory for some time, he started writing his first song when he was 15 and wanted to record it when he was 16. In order to share his songs with other people and musicians, he wanted to record his songs but he was too young and naive enough to cover the expanses of recording. Because of these unlucky situations, he decided to save some money and have a little humble home studio for himself to start recording his own songs. Some years later, he bought his first interface cards and started learning how to record music. He formed a band with his friend from his class named as "Forsaken Fears" and managed to release their first song on Youtube. After getting positive feedbacks of their song, they wanted to release an EP of 8 songs called "Worth Paid by Sins" when they are 17 years old. They got awesome feedbacks from good musicians and even some members of their favourite bands that they did a great job even though the unlucky situations they had because they were naive and too young to handle all of this with their young age. They even shooted their own playthrough video for their instrumental song called "Shred Beatdown". Thanks to the positive feedbacks on their music, they were invited to various awesome muisicans from different countries but unfortunately, they are under 18 and are not eligible to travel on their own. Also they didn't have enough equipment to have their big own live shows. Unfortunately, this band also split up when all of the members started university and had to change their locations.

	<blockquote>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years later, he didn't supress his passion about music and wanted to form another band. With some people he met at his university, he decided to start another band by them. Some months later, they wanted to write new songs. They formen a new band called "Intermission". They recorded 4 different singles but unfortunately they manage to release only 2 of their songs. Unfortunately, that members being busy with their jobs and studies, Intermission couldn't have any live shows. After 2 years working in the same band together, unfortunately the band need to split up.

	<blockquote>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the unfortunate past experiences with his bands, he decided to work on his own songs with the knowledge he has learned since he started making music. He uploaded some videos on Youtube. He played some cover songs by himself and his friend. He also recorded an original song and uploaded it on Youtube. Thanks to the knowledge he has over the years, he wanted to learn some Photoshop in order to design his own merching brand. After he tried to learn some Photoshop and thanks to his designer friend, he managed to design his own t-shirts and merch. Now he plans to sell his music and merch online. He works on his songs and merch.
